excerpt: WATCH THAT BASKET
---
Hi everyone this funny quote popped up in a book I'm reading for a class, *Pudd'nhead Wilson* by Mark Twain. I wanted to post it here because it made me chuckle.  

“Behold, the fool saith, "Put not all thine eggs in the one basket" - which is but a matter of saying, "Scatter your money and your attention"; but the wise man saith, "Pull all your eggs in the one basket and - WATCH THAT BASKET."



I have really enjoyed reading so much fiction for school instead of being barraged with Facts and Things That Happened! I recommend *Ceremony* by Leslie Marmon Silko, something I read for my Indigenous Literature class. It was incredible. I will try to post on here more now that I have removed the tumour known as X/Twitter from my brain. 



xoxo,

Nic
