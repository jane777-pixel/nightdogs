Despite CLEARLY stating in my likes/dislikes that I DISLIKE being poisoned, this preference was IGNORED by the Thai Express in New Minas. They served me a meal that sent me into such a sorry state that I do not dare to divulge any details. Other than that - things are ok. I am reading the first book of many for my honours thesis, *1948* by Benny Morris. It is the "balanced" history of the establishment of Israel (of course written from a Zionist perspective) but man oh man are there problems. I'm sure I'll have plenty to say about that over the next 9 months. Well you've gotta start somewhere. Hard to criticize something if you haven't read several hundred pages of it. 

I have been listening to a lot of tunes these days, mainly Silver Jews and Arthur Russell. The Summer of Bob really fell off this year unfortunately, but it just got to be too much. Forcing myself to write pages about not-so-great albums was getting to be a bit of a chore, and I have enough chores to do! I saw *Whatever Happened to Baby Jane* at the Al Whittle Theatre last week, and man was it great! Bette Davis and Joan Crawford gave all-time great performances, and my enjoyment of the film was only slightly impacted by the horrendously annoying dipshits who were sitting behind me, laughing at every scene and talking constantly until I told them to shut up. At least they stopped talking when I asked! That felt pretty good. I watched Blow-Up (1966) as well, last Sunday. That was a head scratcher. I feel like I may need to see it again sometime.  

Anyways, not much else to report on the Nic front. I am going to have a very busy year! Maybe I should learn Chinese.
