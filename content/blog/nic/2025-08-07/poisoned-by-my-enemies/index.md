Despite making it very clear that I DISLIKE being poisoned, this preference  was IGNORED by Thai Express in New Minas. Other than that I am doing pretty well this summer. I am a third of the way through the first of many many books I will need to read for my honours thesis, and am hoping to finish it by Sunday.
