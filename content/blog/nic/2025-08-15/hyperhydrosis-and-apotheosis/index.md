Good lord has it been hot out. Less so today thank goodness, but man oh man! I have evil overactive sweat glands that want to ruin every shirt I own and make me look like I just finished running 5km when I've really just been sitting in an air conditioned room, but I have acquired a potent  concoction that might help me out a bit. Maybe I'll be able to wear grey shirts again (I love grey).  I spent way too much on a couple of t-shirts online but I just came into a bit of inheritance from my uncle, who isn't dead (just wanted to get rid of his money), so I think treating myself to some cool clothes is okay.  Here are the two wicked cool shirts I got (don't ask how much):

I was way off base when I gave an update on my reading progress for my thesis. I'm still stuck on the same book I was stuck on when I made my last post, unfortunately, but I will HOPEFULLY be able to get it done in the next few days. Reading pure information is not the most relaxing thing to do, especially when you have a deadline. 



In Nic Life News, I have been playing a whole lot of chess lately after my multiple year hiatus from playing online, and I am rising a bit in the ranks, currently sitting at a rating of 1166, which is pretty bad but better than it was last week. That's all that really matters! Ewan came down to the T.A.N. open mic last night and played us a few songs (good job Ewan!), and I brought out a couple new ones as well. I've been planning to write a song for the past 4 years so stay tuned for that sometime in the next decade! 



Anyways - signing off for now, see you guys at night dogs!
