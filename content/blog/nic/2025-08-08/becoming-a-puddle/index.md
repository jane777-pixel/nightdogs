Today is a tired day. I have had a dull ache in my stomach for the past couple days, and all of the acidity in my diet has not been helping! Stop eating ramen for lunch dummy! I read around 60 pages of my book last night, which is decent progress! Especially while taking notes. I hope to complete around the same amount of reading today. At this rate I should be able to finish it by Monday, which means it will be time to start the next book in a long long long list of research materials. I am excited to see my friends tonight at Abby's birthday party (happy birthday Abby)! It's always nice to see people that I like. It's been a pretty good summer on the hanging out front, though I can never get enough of that. I like people! 

I am currently feeling a bit mushy. I was exercising consistently for a whole week and a half, but that unfortunately came to a halt.  Hopefully I can start up again in the next couple of days. It was nice to move around a bit. 

Anyways - bye.
