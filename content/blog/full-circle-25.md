all of our hard work proved worth it and the festival was really successful. i got to enjoy some music that was on my wishlist to catch. i felt very removed from the friend group and i was never around. it is a hard thing to balance hanging out and doing my job. i am always excited to see kevin's art. i hope the volunteers thought i did okay. i didn't get any pictures of myself. i got very few of my friends. i caught night jiffy on camera but not #nightdogs. i hope people like the program, it took a long time to make but it was really fun. it will be strange not talking to kim every day, she's really great. i always feel at home when i'm in avondale.

i was able to get a good tent spot away from the path of others. we could see nicky's house, where jackie lives now. i used to play there when i was a kid, with olly and finn. they are usually at the festival but i didn't see them this year. i heard they might be in bc, olly moved there for school i think a couple years ago, but usually made it back in the summer. i feel toasty inside thinking about how lucky am to be able to come back to this place, this community.

i got to tell orion about the lydia and sally. he didn't believe they had old wine just sitting on the shelf, he didn't believe there were wineries before a certain date, but i've been around this boathouse a while and have absorbed information about it. everyone else calls it the shipyard, i wonder why i say that. i found another one with a more intact label. no one steals it.

this is mala, maria denicolas dog. i remember her from when i was a kid too. her sister, anna, was a single mom to chokyi, she was younger than us but we would still play when we were kids. i think she had a hard time as a kid, the family was disjointed. they live on a farm on belmont road. the chickens and geese used to chase me. we had and still have bees there.

just like last year, the rain held out until the very end of the festival. on my way home, there was a cow on the road.
