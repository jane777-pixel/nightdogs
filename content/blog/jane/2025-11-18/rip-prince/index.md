hey, it's been a while...

currently in the library "studying" and thought a new blog post might be a fantastic method of procrastination

## knitting

finished [Nic's socks](https://www.ravelry.com/projects/jay777marie/dk-weight-vanilla-socks) (I think the day after my last post?). Ran out of orange yarn so he gets a funky toe. DK socks are fun... fingering weight not so much. I guess I am a little impatient haha.

Since it's gotten cold, I've been getting a lot of wear out of the sweaters I've made. Would love to cast on another over winter break

## swimming

on a ridiculously warm october day, Willow and I went for a lovely swim between my classes. tried my best to soak in the feeling of warm moss under my feet, and all the warm colours.

my next swim was much colder... but serves as a segue into the next heading
