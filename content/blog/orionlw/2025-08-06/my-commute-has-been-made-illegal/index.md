It appears my bike commute on the Harvest Moon Trail has just been [made illegal](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hiking-ban-vehicles-wildfire-concerns-1.7019695), with a fine of $25 000. 

I would now have to risk my life on the roads of New Minas just getting to work by bike. They really don't think of bike commuters at all here. Its not like I'm gonna throw a cigarette butt off my bike like people in cars do!

Pretty wild to put in such a broad law on such short notice with so many unanswered questions.

UPDATE 2025-08-06 2PM

Update on the travel ban: I may be able to get a permit at no cost, waiting to hear back from Dept. of Nat. Resources. 

I was also interviewed by CBC NS today. Talked about how this sudden change effects commuters, and issues that they didn't account for with this sudden travel ban. So you'll hear my voice on the Mainstreet NS radio program and hopefully on the web article too!

And it's understood by me that we gotta protects NS from fire, but I don't believe this is the way.
