It appears my bike commute on the Harvest Moon Trail has just been [made illegal](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/hiking-ban-vehicles-wildfire-concerns-1.7019695), with a fine of $25 000. 

I would now have to risk my life on the roads of New Minas just getting to work by bike. They really don't think of bike commuters at all here. Its not like I'm gonna throw a cigarette butt off my bike like people in cars do!

Pretty wild to put in such a broad law on such short notice with so many unanswered questions.
