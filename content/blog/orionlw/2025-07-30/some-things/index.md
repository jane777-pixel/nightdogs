I've wanted to write about my experience at the Creative Music Workshop that happened a couple weeks ago, but I'm really at a loss for words. It was a wonderful experience to be that immersed in music. I had trouble returning to the real worldâ€”work, emails, all that. I hope I can hold on to some of that magic from that week.
